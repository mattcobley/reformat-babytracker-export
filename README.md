# reformat-babytracker-export

Reformats the CSV data exported from BabyTracker app into something useful that can be used in Excel to create a line chart across the entire data history - the app will only show three months, maximum.


Note that the data outputted from the app does NOT use the "split at midnight" option, even if that setting is turned on.
